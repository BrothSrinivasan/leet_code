# Design the class structure for a banking system using object-oriented principles
# Your design must have at least 5 classes
# Each class must have at least 2 variables and 2 functions (doesn't need to be implemented, just declared)
# You must also use 1 enum

2) Are we focusing on just regular account holders or everyone involved with a banking?
3) Besides balance, what information should an account hold?
